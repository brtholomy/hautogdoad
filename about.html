<p>In this little patch of grass I’m supposed to leave a neat pile of well-digested fictions. I’m supposed display my willingness to cooperate in the proper exchange: while your job is to buttress another pathetic obsequious narcissism, to contribute to what will likely amount to a fugitive cultural legitimacy, and for authorizing another pantomimed interrogation of the human condition as though a mutual conspiratorial will to ignorance has not been tried before, I’m supposed to relieve you of your doubts, apologize for the status quo, contribute to a communal sense of moral immunity, and begin painting over the last shitty fresco of <em>mundus perfectissimus</em>…</p>
<p>I’m supposed to list credentials. But in our modernity, everything worthwhile is <em>outside</em>. The further away from the center it is, the more its potential value: yet there is such a surplus of windblown garbage out here in the corona of civilization, I cannot blame anyone for mistaking my passion for just another disposable fragment of collective neurosis - or merely another angry white male.</p>
<p>What do I want to say?</p>
<ul>
<li>That you should read my book: if you've made it this far don't hesitate.</li>
<li>That you should listen to my music: if you want to know who I am, it's all there.</li>
<li>That I won’t waste your time, because I don’t waste mine.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are more of us than there seems to be. The first task is to find each other - but overcoming our trusty mistrust and faithful misanthropy, cannot and should not be simple. Do not trust me, <em>test</em> me - and I will do the same.</p>
