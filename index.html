    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1737889404">The Moral Disease</a>
  </p>

<p>Taking COVID-19 as a starting point, we ask: what is mass hysteria and why does it seem so closely related to moral phenomena? Can we exploit this grotesque spectacle of moral panic in order to learn to see and think amorally? Can we learn to distinguish between moral posturing and ethical character? If moral posturing is ubiquitous in our age, what can this tell us about ourselves? What does it reveal about our collective health? If we are as radically unhealthy as this might suggest, how did we become so? Is there a discernible history to the <i>moral disease</i>?</p>

<p>Drawing on Foucault, Nietzsche, Arendt, Freud, and many more, this is a study of moral phenomena from the Axial Age philosophical revolutions, to the religious fervor of late antiquity, to the totalitarian movements of the 20th century, to the latest illuminating tales of the “immorality of morality” in our own impotent, absurd, and yet ominous age. Once again, the spirit of skepticism and healthy thinking is tested against the histrionic fictions of the protofascist: we seem bound to repeat our mistakes, but that should not compel the courageous and rational to preemptive silence.</p>

    "The fiery gate, disillusionment. The power of a question mark, hanging all over what you love."
  </p>

  <p>
    From the overpowering hypocrisies of COVID, to the rediscovery and refinement of inner strength in the wake of many losses, to the joys of deepening solitude: this album traces a path many of you are already familiar with.

    Fall 2021

  <p>
    My voice grew confident. All concerns for innovating in the purely technical aspects of music seem trivial: what matters is that my words get across, that my voice is strong and precise in its emotional coloration, that the imagination soars, the mind reels, the heart swells.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have discovered that "rap" - which is chant, the urform of <i>verse and chorus</i>, the power of an inspired human voice - is what we need. We are seeking the medicine once handed out by elders around the fire: the old songs, the incarnate power of oral transmission, the deep knowing. Ceremony is lacking, and yet still alongside us every day waiting to be rediscovered: even if it's in the guise of the pop song, we must work our way back to it, without seeking to skip ahead to a premature solemnity nor seeking to imitate a "spiritual" demeanor we have not earned...

<p>I teach a small number of students via telephone consultation and other means.</p>
<p>I am a psychologist by training but I am not a psychotherapist. If what you want is a hole to dump your pain into, look elsewhere. I consider my teaching post-therapeutic: for those who may not be done grieving, but are ready for another horizon of growth.</p>
<p>What do I teach?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How to <em>see</em>: which means disentagling salvagable character from the habit of lying to yourself.</p></li>
<li><p>How to <em>think</em>: which means unlearning formerly adaptive acculturation to willful stupidity.</p></li>
<li><p>How to <em>act</em>: which means assimilating and magnifying your existing courage and independence.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Tools you may acquire along the way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Psychoanalytic interpretation.</li>
<li>Sitting meditation - 坐禪 in the old sense.</li>
<li>Qigong techniques.</li>
</ul>
<p>Demarcations along the path:</p>
<ul>
<li>You stop wasting time on meaningless toil.</li>
<li>Your standard for companionship rises.</li>
<li>You discover and articulate what you want.</li>
<li>You find the motivation for doing what you love.</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<p>I currently teach men only. Sliding scale fees. Phone sessions weekly. Personalized retreats available to advanced students. If English is not your first language, we can work around the problem. Español, Deutsch, 普通話.</p>

  about

<div class="text">

<p>As tempted as I am to show off an acerbic cynicism regarding all projects of self-revelation, while simultaneously calling attention to a nauseating ritual of mutual narcissistic consolation - anyone reading this might already be more of an ally than that treatment assumes. Maybe it’s time for all of us artists who have hidden ourselves away and put our hopes to sleep with the almost comforting dead weight of disappointment, to be a little more honest and brave.</p>
<p>I’m a psychologist, author, and musician. I currently live off grid in a desert wilderness with my small tribe of animals. Most of what I am and have been is clearly legible in my work, for those who know how to read and listen. And yet what I feel is important to say here, is not <i>what I am to myself</i>, but what I want my work to be for a few others.</p>
<p>Teaching is my final ambition: I feel more than ever, that there is a small but slowly emerging cadre of young people so nauseated by the bovine comedy of this “first” world, that a tenuous window of human renaissance is hovering in the margins - where once I saw only more reasons to invest in solitude, I now see opportunities for many conversations long overdue.</p>
