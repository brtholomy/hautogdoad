Study with Bartholomy
</p>

<div class="text">

<p>Ambling through yet another obscure yet strangely overcrowded Parisian backalley, I once saw a sign that read, in English, “Massage Reeducation”. Sometimes I wonder if my talk of “studentship” does not come off similarly ominous and perverse. Am I the intellectual equivalent of a lonely karate teacher seeking to impress you with his roundhouse kick? Or am I more like the balding depressed therapist who invites you into his stuffy cat-stained world of dust and indigestion? Or perhaps I’m already half-mad with power, strolling in a white robe through my desert compound, promising whole star systems in the afterlife to the devoted few.</p>

<p>There is risk in seeking out a real teacher. Transference is inevitable, idealization is possible, disappointment is likely. But so is surprise, joy, and a sudden freefall through many previously forbidding stages of growth. I challenge my students, but I also <em>advocate</em> for them in ways they have not yet learned to do.</p>

<p>You will benefit from many years of wandering, gathering, and sifting: behind me stand a long line of therapists skillful and clumsy, patients neurotic and schizophrenic, gurus false and genuine, curanderos, professors, monks, dangerous wannabes and earnest adepts. Studying with me should be more valuable than many years of university or autodidacticism, because I have marked the few traversable paths through this swamp of procrastination and wishful thinking. The mark of real education is the ability to ask <em>good questions</em>, not the hoarding of answers: you will learn how to learn, such that you no longer need me.</p>

<p>Our task is to transform what previously crippled you into an advantage. We will transform useless self-sacrifice into effective discipline, nauseated compassion into merciless insight, anxiety into vigilance, bitterness into resolve, woundedness into depth.</p>

<p>What do I teach?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How to <em>see</em>: which means disentangling salvageable character from the habit of lying to yourself.</p></li>
<li><p>How to <em>think</em>: which means unlearning formerly adaptive acculturation to willful stupidity.</p></li>
<li><p>How to <em>act</em>: which means exposing the mantras of paralysis which currently exhaust the unconscious intelligence of your body.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Tools you may acquire along the way:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Psychoanalytic interpretation</strong>. Although I have reasons for avoiding fashionable Lacanian vocabulary, I should mention that my own analytic lineage is only few degrees removed from Lacan himself: the New York and Parisian psychoanalytic oral tradition is therefore part of what I have to pass on.</li>
<li><strong>Meditative discipline</strong> - 坐禪 in the old sense. My lineage here stems from the Liuhebafa schools of Hong Kong and the southern Daoists. Qigong and martial forms available to advanced students.</li>
<li><strong>Intellectual development</strong>. There may be required reading from Nietzsche, Freud, select ancient texts, and many more. Every student receives a unique focused curriculum.</li>
</ul>

<p>Demarcations along the path:</p>

<ul>
<li>You stop wasting time on meaningless toil.</li>
<li>You discover and articulate what you want.</li>
<li>Your standard for companionship rises.</li>
<li>You find the motivation for doing what you love.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sliding scale fees: this is not merely an expensive yoga class, but a holistic training that should last a lifetime.</p>

<p>Phone sessions weekly. Personalized retreats available to advanced students. If English is not your first language, we can work around the problem. Español, Deutsch, 普通話.</p>

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>

<p>Write a short essay in response to the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Briefly describe your situation. How do you spend your time?</li>
<li>How do you feel right now?</li>
<li>What do you want to learn?</li>
<li>What have you studied previously?</li>
<li>Indicate which timezone you'll be calling from.</li>
<li>Please confirm that you understand this is not psychotherapy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your privacy is important. Therefore at this stage there is no need to reveal identifying details.</p>
