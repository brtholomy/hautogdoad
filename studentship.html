I teach meditation. My methods are effective because they are tested, distilled, and unencumbered by metaphysical nonsense.
</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Meditation</strong>: 20+ years of practice. I've studied within the Zen, Tibetan, yogic, and Daoist disciplines: from each I learned something essential I'm prepared to pass on.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<strong>Engineering</strong>: I'm a former software engineer at Google. My goal has been to approach spirituality with the precision and robust standards more commonly found in this field.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<strong>Psychoanalysis</strong>: I have postgraduate-level training within New York psychoanalytic circles.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Method</h2>

<p>
We discard the absurd fantasies and priestly agendas which have plagued meditative practice: I teach meditation and self-development as a form of remedial neuronal training. We're interested in the frontiers of human potential: my method seeks to exploit nonlinear emergence via conditioning of the many unconscious subsystems, which produces a far greater yield of intelligent behaviors at the conscious niveaux than the usual topdown approach. But unconscious entanglements must be attacked from several angles simultaneously to yield results: the unconscious symbolic domain is where most spiritual development stalls - thus analytic interpretation constitutes the other leading feature of my method.
</p>

<p>
When this method works, you should become more intelligent and yet receptive, energetic and yet restful, imaginative and yet factual, playful and yet serious.
</p>
