<p>
I have formal training in psychoanalysis and other disciplines, but I choose to operate outside normative expectations.
</p>

<p>
What do I teach?
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How to <em>see</em>: which means disentangling salvageable character from the habit of lying to yourself for the sake of others. You discover how much you already know.</p></li>
<li><p>How to <em>think</em>: which means unlearning formerly adaptive acculturation to willful stupidity. You discover how smart you already are.</p></li>
<li><p>How to <em>act</em>: which means exposing the mantras of paralysis which exhaust the unconscious intelligence of your body. You discover how powerful you can be.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You will benefit from many years of wandering, gathering, and sifting: behind me stand a long line of therapists skillful and clumsy, patients neurotic and schizophrenic, gurus false and genuine, curanderos, professors, monks, dangerous wannabes and earnest adepts. Studying with me should be more valuable than many years of university or autodidacticism, because I have marked the few traversable paths through this swamp of procrastination and wishful thinking. The mark of real education is the ability to ask <em>good questions</em>, not the hoarding of answers: you will learn how to learn, such that you no longer need me.</p>

<p>Tools you may acquire along the way:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Psychoanalytic interpretation</strong>. The best of what psychoanalytic education can offer, is a renewed childlike appreciation of the unknown. The frontier is near at hand. But the transmission of this method is no mere theoretical exercise: it involves reorienting your centers of gratification toward the exploration of the unconscious. The New York and Parisian psychoanalytic oral tradition is part of what I have to pass on.</li>
<li><strong>Intellectual development</strong>. There may be readings from Nietzsche, Freud, select ancient texts, and many more. Every student receives a unique focused curriculum.</li>
<li><strong>Meditative discipline</strong>. I teach meditation as a form of <em>remedial neurological training</em>, not as clandestine penance nor simpering worship. My lineage here stems from the southern Daoists and the Liuhebafa schools of Hong Kong. Qigong and martial forms available to advanced students.</li>
<li><strong>Wilderness training</strong>. We may practice tracking, hunting, firecraft, woodcraft, construction, et cetera. This phase is for advanced students.</li>
</ul>

<p>Demarcations along the path:</p>

<ul>
<li>You discover and articulate what you want.</li>
<li>Your respect for yourself deepens.</li>
<li>You find the motivation for doing what you love.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sliding scale fees: this is not merely another indulgent yoga class, but a holistic training.</p>

<p>Telephone sessions weekly. Desert retreats available to advanced students. If English is not your first language, we can work around the problem. Español, Deutsch, 普通話.</p>

<p>
The initial consultation session is free.
</p>

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>

<p>
A good student will often hesitate, feeling unqualified and intimidated: but <em>sincerity, humility, and courage</em> are required, not foreknowledge or polish. I can teach anyone with these characteristics.
</p>

<p>Ask yourself this question:
<em>What do you want to learn?</em>
