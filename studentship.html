Study with Bartholomy
</p>

<div class="text">

<p>
Ambling through yet another obscure yet strangely overcrowded Parisian backalley, I once saw a sign that read, in English, "Massage Reeducation". Sometimes I wonder if my talk of "studentship" does not come off similarly ominous and perverse. Am I the intellectual equivalent of a lonely karate teacher seeking to impress you with his roundhouse kick? Or am I more like the balding depressed therapist who invites you into his stuffy cat-stained world of dust and indigestion? Or perhaps I'm already half-mad with power, strolling in a white robe through my desert compound, promising whole star systems in the afterlife to the devoted few.
</p>

<p>
There is risk in seeking out a real teacher. Transference is inevitable, idealization is possible, dissapointment is likely. But so is surprise, joy, and a sudden freefall through many previously forbidding stages of growth. I challenge my students, but I also <i>advocate</i> for them in ways they have not yet learned to do.
</p>

<p>
In studying with me, you are benefitting from many years of wandering, gathering, and sifting: behind me stand a long line of therapists skillful and clumsy, patients neurotic and schizophrenic, gurus false and genuine, curanderos, professors, monks, dangerous wannabes and earnest adepts.
</p>

<p>What do I teach?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How to <em>see</em>: which means disentagling salvagable character from the habit of lying to yourself.</p></li>
<li><p>How to <em>think</em>: which means unlearning formerly adaptive acculturation to willful stupidity.</p></li>
<li><p>How to <em>act</em>: which means assimilating and magnifying your existing courage and independence.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Tools you may acquire along the way:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Psychoanalytic interpretation</strong>. Although I avoid using Lacanian vocabulary for good reasons, I should mention that my own analytic lineage is only few degrees removed from Lacan himself: the NYC and Parisian psychoanalytic oral tradition are therefore part of what I have to pass on.</li>
<li><strong>Qigong technique and sitting meditation</strong> - 坐禪 in the old sense. My lineage here stems from the Liuhebafa schools of Hong Kong and the southern Daoists.</li>
<li><strong>Intellectual development</strong>. There may be recommended and required reading from Nietzsche, Freud, and selected ancient texts.</li>
</ul>

<p>Demarcations along the path:</p>

<ul>
<li>You stop wasting time on meaningless toil.</li>
<li>You discover and articulate what you want.</li>
<li>Your standard for companionship rises.</li>
<li>You find the motivation for doing what you love.</li>
</ul>

<p>Sliding scale fees. Phone sessions weekly. Personalized retreats available to advanced students. If English is not your first language, we can work around the problem. Español, Deutsch, 普通話.</p>

<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>

<p>Write a short essay in response to the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Briefly describe your situation. How do you spend your time?</li>
<li>How do you feel right now?</li>
<li>What do you want to learn?</li>
<li>What have you studied previously?</li>
<li>Please confirm that you understand this is not psychotherapy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your privacy is important. Therefore at this stage there is no need to reveal identifying details.</p>
